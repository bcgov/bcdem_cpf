/**
 * <p>The <code>BusinessApplicationPlugin</code> annotation marks a Java class as a CPF business
 * application plug-in. The plug-in class must have the <code>public</code> keyword, be defined in a separate
 * Java file, must not be in the default package (must have a package declaration) and must not
 * have the <code>final</code> keyword.</p>
 *
 * <p>The instance of the plug-in is executed within a single thread so does not need to be
 * synchronized. Any services that it uses must however be thread safe as they will be used by
 * multiple instances of the plug-in in different threads.</p>
 *
 * <p class="note">NOTE: An instance of the plug-in class is created for each request processed by the plug-in.
 * Therefore state will not be maintained between requests it must not include the initialization
 * of any resources that have significant overhead to create. These should be defined as spring
 * beans and made available to the plug-in using spring dependency injection.
 * If there are data structures that vary based
 * on the parameters to a request then these can be created within the plug-in.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following code fragment shows the implementation of a plug-in class using all of the
 * annotation elements.</p>
